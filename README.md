# ImageProcessing_with_RaspberryPI

Hardware: Raspberry Pi 3b 1gb ram, 64gb microsd card  
Operating system: Raspbian OS  
Software: Thonny IDE, Linux Terminal  

## Introduction
The purpose of our project is to understand how image processing can perform on a single board computer such as the Raspberry Pi 3 model B. Here, we will discuss the process of using image processing algorithms and the results we receive from the Pi 3. There is also the importance of analyzing performance metrics and how the relation between the computer architecture of the Raspberry Pi 3 model B. Throughout this document, we will go through the procedure of testing image processing on the Pi 3 and its validity in being able to perform image processing
